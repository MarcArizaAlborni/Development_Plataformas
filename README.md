About the game:

This first release is a simple platformer game, made for a single player where you have to get to the end of the level. There are currently only two levels.
To move across the map the player can use basic mechanics as Moving Left/Right and jumping. There are also other movement mechanics such as Dashing and transforming 
into a small slime which has a smaller collider which allows you to reach certain areas that can't be reached by normal means.
